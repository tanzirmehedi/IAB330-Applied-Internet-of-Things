Environment Setup: 

Installing Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu 24.04: 

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Jupyter Notebook supports Python 3.3 or later. You can install Python 3 by executing:

~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
~~~

Step 1: Install pip

~~~
sudo apt install python3-pip
~~~

Step 2: Upgrade pip (Optional)

~~~
pip3 install --upgrade pip
~~~

Step 3: Install Jupyter Notebook

~~~
pip3 install notebook
~~~

Step 4: Start and Access Jupyter Notebook

~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~

Jupyter Notebook will start, and your web browser will open displaying the Notebook dashboard. If it does not open automatically, open your web browser and type the following URL:

~~~
http://{your-ip}:8888/
~~~

Now, you should see the Jupyter Notebook interface, where you can create new notebooks, open existing notebooks, or manage your files.
